This is modification of Klaus Pontoppidan's pyradlite (https://github.com/pontoppi/radlite) with small edits to radlite.py and radmc.py to make it work with the latest version of radmc3dPy. It also images (data cubes) to be made so as to model spectroastrometry. Example notebooks and scripts are included to demonstrate utility (the former are more for use as a tutorial and the scripts are better for fitting to data).

Instructions on running this version of radlite are in a notion page posted here
