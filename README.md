This is modification of Klaus Pontoppidan's pyradlite (https://github.com/pontoppi/radlite) with small edits to radlite.py and radmc.py to make it work with radmc3dPy, and implementation of making the imaging part work so as to model spectroastrometry. Example notebooks and scripts are included to demonstrate utility (the former are more for use as a tutorial and the scripts are better for fitting to data).

Instructions on running this version of radlite are in a notion page posted here
